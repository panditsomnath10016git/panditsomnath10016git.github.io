Multivariable calculus is the calculus of more than one variable as the name indicates.
For most of the real-life application functions of several variables are dealt more
frequently than the functions of a single variable. Integration and differentiation are
the two important operations of Calculus. In this project I dealt mostly with the
Integration part.
Multiple integral and line integral are the topics under integrals of multivariable
functions. Double and triple integrals may be used to calculate areas and volumes
of regions in the plane and in space. For evaluating multiple integrals as repeated
single integrals we need Fubini’s Theorem. Line integral is used to integrate along
a curve in a field, and to calculate the length of a wire curved in space or work
done along a path in a field. Two types of functions are are discussed here - scalar
functions and vector functions. Vector functions are used to describe physical fields
as vector fields

  - Created lucid notes on Integrals of Multivariable Functions.
  - Illustrations with animations generated with python MANIM library.
  - Work report is available at [https://fossee.in/fellowship/2020](https://fossee.in/fellowship/2020).
  - Codes used to generate animation available at [FOSSEE_github](https://github.com/FOSSEE/FSF-mathematics-python-code-archive/tree/master/FSF-2020/calculus-of-several-variables)
