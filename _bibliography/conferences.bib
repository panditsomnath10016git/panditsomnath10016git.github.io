    abstract     = {Moiré technique is one of the highly sensitive non-contact method to
measure surface deformations due to strain.
In literature, Moiré patterns are made using holographic
photolithography, electron beam lithography, focused ion beam (FIB)
lithography and nanoimprint lithography (NIL).
Some of these techniques need very expensive and precise equipments
like vibration isolation platform, nano stage, which makes fabrication and
mass manufacturing difficult.
Here, we propose picosecond laser micromachining as a reliable
technique for embedding optical microstructures such as gratings at
various depths of a material. The proposed membranes can be used as
strain sensors for health monitoring of various structures, importantly in
underground mines wherein all-optical sensors are in great demand.

coated on a SiO$_2$/ TiO2 one-dimensional photonic crystal (1DPhC) structure are presented. 
The spectral narrowing of the Tamm state aided amplified spontaneous emission from the structure is attributed to the strong confinement of Tamm mode in the 
DCM dye doped PVA layer sandwiched between 1DPhC and Ag thin film.},
