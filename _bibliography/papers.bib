	abstract = {Optical Tamm structures have potential for the development of optoelectronic devices, provided they overcome the challenge of low-quality factor of modes and inherent losses associated with plasmonic metal films. In this work, we present lasing in a super-Tamm structure consisting of a silver thin film deposited on a 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4- dimethylaminostyryl)-H-pyran (DCM) dye-doped polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) spacer layer coated on a 
		SiO2/TiO2 one-dimensional photonic crystal with a lasing threshold of ~0.07 mJ. The spectral line narrowing and threshold characteristics observed in the emission spectrum corroborate the realization of a waveguided super-Tamm laser. The bi-exponential temporal decay profile of the Tamm lasing modes with an average lifetime of 0.52 ± 0.02 ns confirms the Purcell enhancement of radiative intensity of the DCM dye when coupled to the super-Tamm modes.},
