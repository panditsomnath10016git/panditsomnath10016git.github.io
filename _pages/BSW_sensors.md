Photonic crystal is periodic arrangement of dielectric materials to control the flow of light,
it shows photonic bandgap much like electronic bandgap in atomic crystals. By properly engi-
neering the PhC we can create and control certain optical modes, which are extremely sensitive
to different ambient conditions, showing its potential as ultra-sensitive sensors. My research
is oriented towards photonic devices in general but focused on sensors, explicitly starting
with photonic crystal Bloch surface wave (BSW) sensors under the guidance of Dr. Shivakiran
Bhaktha, Phys. dept. and Prof. Prasanta Kumar Guha, Electronics and Electrical Commu-
nication Engg. dept., IIT Kharagpur.

Furthermore, I am interested in studying the behaviour of different modes of PhC (i.e. BSW,
cavity, band-edge) when 2D materials are incorporated. With a viable practical device, compact
integration and commercialization are also being looked forward to.

There is a growing need for mobile, cost-effective, sensing applications mainly in health care,
agriculture, and food quality control. But most of the existing methods have drawbacks limiting
their on-field deployment with the required sensitivity. PhC platform will address this need for
compact, extremely sensitive, non-invasive, label-free, stable, robust sensors.
