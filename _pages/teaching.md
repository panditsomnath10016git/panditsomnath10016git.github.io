From January 2024, I joined as a physics tutor to higher secondary students in BNR Excellence Academy, Gole Bazar Kharagpur-721301. This knowledge sharing is one of the deliverables as a Prime Minister's Research Fellow.

Before joining M.Sc., I worked as a FOSSEE summer fellow for two months under IIT Bombay. During this period I worked on creating illustrative [notes](https://math.animations.fossee.in/contents/calculus-of-several-variables) to aid students with Integrals of Multivariable Functions.

----
During my B.Sc. I have provided teaching services to students in my locality as a social service directed by Ramakrishna Mission. I continue to teach them whenever I am available.
