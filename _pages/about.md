Welcome to my page. I am currently doing research in School of Nanoscience and Technology at IIT Kharagpur as a Prime Minister's Research Fellow. My field of work is `optics and photonics`.

More than being fascinated by the underlying laws of the universe and the challenge of understanding it, the history of science and how it has shaped human civilization overwhelms me.
I got attracted to the field of photonics during my higher studies for its potential to handle the exponential demand for computing power, its promise of new-age sensing technologies, and its opportunity to test the theories of physics itself.

My current work is on development of ultrasensitive sensors based on [photonic-crystal](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.2059) platform mainly for healthcare, agricultural, environmental applications.
